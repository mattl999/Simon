Welcome to Simon (In Space)!

Simon is a memory game that challenges the player to memorize and repeat increasingly long sequences of colours. The original Simon was launched in 1978 as an electronic toy that was manufactured by Milton Bradley. The game was an instant success, and is manufactured and sold to this day!

# Brain-Training :muscle:
Simon is a fun and engaging game, with the benefit of testing and improving your memory while you play! The game requires lots of focus, and the smallest distraction can prevent you from reaching your new highscore. The current world record in a game of Simon is 84, set by a Canadian Simon enthusiast! 

The brain is a muscle, and if you practice long enough (by playing my game) that record can one day be yours!
