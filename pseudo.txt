-step 1- define all constants in the game:
    
    will include the sound effects to be linked with the button constants.
  

-step 2- Define variables involving fucntionality-


-step 3- Adding event listeners.


-step 4- Create initialize fucntion

It will be tied to the restart button and called if the 'playerLost" variable is true.
 
-step 5- Write the functio n for the alien's blinking lights
This will involve using math.random, set timeout method and pushing the values into the alien's array, as well as 
changing the turn variable to 'player'.

-step 6-Write the function for the player's turn
I don't know the details yet but it will involve logic after each input to determine if the player was wrong.
If wrong - 1 health and call the alien function again with the turn index value set -1 (to restart the turn) - add glass crack image and sound.
If right increase point gain per turn, call alien function.

-Step 7- win logic?
As of now there is no winning planned for the game but if there is enough time, add alien hp that goes down once every 5 turns and maybe an animation or image change for the alien. maybe 15 turns to win.
